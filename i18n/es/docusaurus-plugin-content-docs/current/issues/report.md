# How to Report an Issue

The community appreciates your effort in helping improve Pond0x! When reporting an issue, please follow the guidelines below when reporting a problem.

Before proceeding, please read through the [existing issues](/docs/issues) to ensure yours has not already been reported.  If it has, and you have additional context, that is also appreciated.

## What to Include in Your Issue Report

### 1. **Clear Description**
   - Provide a short, descriptive summary for the issue.
   - Example: "There is a broken link on the Mining page" or "This image is not loading on mobile devices."

### 2. **Steps to Reproduce**
   - Include a step-by-step description of how to reproduce the issue.
   - Be as detailed as possible.
   - Example:
     1. Go to the **Swap** page.
     2. Complete a transaction like normal.
     3. Observe the error message.

### 3. **Expected vs. Actual Behavior**
   - Clearly describe what you expected to happen.
   - Detail what actually happened instead.
   - Example:
     - **Expected:** Success message should appear.
     - **Actual:** Error message "Failed Transaction" appears.

### 4. **Screenshots or Videos**
   - Attach screenshots or a screen recording to visually demonstrate the issue.
   - Highlight or annotate the specific problem if possible.

### 5. **Environment Details**
   - Specify the environment where the issue occurred (if applicable):
     - **Device:** (e.g., Desktop, iPhone 13, Samsung Galaxy S21)
     - **Operating System:** (e.g., Windows 11, macOS Ventura, Android 12)
     - **Browser:** (e.g., Chrome 118.0.5993.89, Firefox 120.0)
     - **Resolution:** (e.g., 1920x1080, 375x667)

### 6. **Impact**
   - Explain how the issue impacts the website or its users:
     - Is it a cosmetic issue, functionality problem, or critical bug?
     - Example:
       - "Transaction says it failes but actually succeeds. Noncritical functionality bug"
       - "The mine button doesn't work on my [phone abc]. Critical bug"
       - "The colors on x page do not meet accessibility guidelines. Cosmetic"

### 7. **Additional Notes**
   - Include any other relevant details or context.
   - Example: "This issue started after the last update," or "It only happens when logged out."
