## My Friends

This tab will supply you with your friend referral code / link.  Share this with your swapping friends to share wins.  More friends -> more wins. I recommend always using a referral code when you swap. If you need one, you can [use mine](/tips) =).

It will also show you your number of referrals, transactions, and earnings. These are not updated instantly and often take some time to load in.

## Top Friends
