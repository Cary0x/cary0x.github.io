# Manifest Data

This data is exactly how it is returned in your manifest on Pond0x. I do not alter the data.

If you are tracking swap updatesâ€“ note that it can take 3-5 minutes.

Enter your Solana address to get your main manifest data.

<ManifestData />

**Swaps** - The number of swaps you have done that Pond0x recognizes. (This system sometimes goes down, so it will vary compared to your on-chain transaction history.)

**Has Twitter** - Determines if your X account is properly connected. If you are expecting True and it is False, please wait for the Pro Dashboard to fix it.

**Badges** - Your badges. If you are expecting more, please check the Teleporting page for known issues.

**Cope** - There are only a few Copers. If you are one, sort your life out.

**Is Pro** - Determines if you have a currently-active Pro account.

**Pro Ago** - Counts how many days since your last Pro purchase. If it is greater than 30 (for a monthly purchase), you are up for renewal.
