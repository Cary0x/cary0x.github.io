# Luck Data

This data is exactly how it is returned on Pond0x. I do not alter the data (besides rounding to 2 decimal points).

Enter your Solana address to get your main manifest data.

<LuckData />

**Luck** - The Luck number as it appears on your [My Wins](https://www.pond0x.com/solana/leaderboard) page.

**Impact** - Various tags to show you what might be modifying your Luck score.

(You can in fact have multiples of any of these things. UI will only show 0-10. These gradually return to default every slow window. E.g. if your burn is outside of that range, it will no longer be counted. E.g. if your referrals are outside of that range, it will no longer be counted.)
