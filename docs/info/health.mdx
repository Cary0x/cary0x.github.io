# Mining Health

This data is exactly how it is returned on Pond0x. I do not alter the data (besides setting to 2 decimal points).

Note, if you do not have PRO, you will not get results (yet).

Enter your Solana address to get your main manifest data.

<HealthData />

## Data

**Health** - Your rigs total health. It ranges from 1-9. 7 fills the bar to 100%, so you can technically be 129% healthy.

**Mining Sessions** - Number of total mining sessions.

**In Mempool** - Number of total mining sessions in the Mempool.

**Sent** - Number of total mining sessions that have been claimed.

**Failed** - Number of total mining sessions that have failed.

**Drifted** - Number of total mining sessions that have drifted.

**Drift Risk** - Number of total mining sessions that are at risk of drifting.

**Priority** - Ranges from 1-100. Seems to be an indicator on where you are on the claims lists. Higher is better.

**Estimated SOL USD** - Estimated earned rewards in SOL USD.

**Estimated wPond USD** - Estimated earned rewards in wPond USD.

**Estimated Drift Risk USD** - Estimated rewards at risk of being drifted in USD.

**Estimated Max Claim Estimate USD** - Estimated maximum potential rewards in USD.

**Estimated Drifted USD** - Estimated drifted rewards in USD.

**AI Notes** - These are notes that you can use to improve the health of your rig to prevent drifting and maximize rewards.

### Market Dependency

- All estimations and values are based on current **market prices**—especially the price of **SOL**.
- Everything from **spam thresholds**, **outflow behavior**, and **claim value** to **user contribution scores** is influenced by the price of SOL.
- The system is **fluid**, with recalculations happening every **60–90 seconds**.
- A small change in **wpond** can shift everything—prices, multipliers, and thresholds are interconnected.

### Dynamic Thresholds

- Your **user threshold** is set based on real-time variables and multipliers.
- As you profit, your **cap as a user lowers**, encouraging you to **improve your multipliers**.
- Understanding these thresholds can increase your share of future claims.

### Health Insights

- Pond0x monitors conditions and fires **AI-generated messages** when issues arise.
- These messages are based on interval assessments of rig data, generating **fair but non-fixed** health insights.
- No LLMs are directly involved to avoid hallucinations or creating unfair advantages.

### Strategies for Success

- The goal is to **maximize your rig's outcome potential**, regardless of time horizon (3 months, 1 year, 30 hours).
- Learning how to **shape your metrics** is more important than simply waiting out lock periods.
- Ideal strategy: **Try something, see what happens, reinforce what works**.

### (Feature coming soon) Data & Trends

- Users can access 3 main data views:
  1. **Sessions in Mempool**
  2. **Likely to Drift**
  3. **Has Drifted**
- Each includes **amount, signatures, and block information**.
- These views help identify what’s working, what isn’t, and how trends evolve with price fluctuations.

### Important Notes

- Don’t jump in with **100 SOL** boosts without understanding the system—expectations must be managed.
- The **speed of activity is fast**. Sessions, locks, and boosts can shift in under a minute.

### Boosting & Swapping

- Buying Boosts affects your **multiplier and tipping metrics**, improving your **claim likelihood**.
- **Swaps activity** adds momentum and ties into **Giga Swap rewards**.
- PLUG creates overall system momentum—especially when SOL is rising, which improves health faster.

### Miner Lifecycle Impact

- **Newer miners** see faster value changes.
- **Older miners** need more activity due to **weighed averages**.
  - E.g., 800+ sessions might need major activity to shift values.
  - 1000s of sessions could take 1000s of interactions.
- **Data resets per epoch**, recalculating values based on prior performance.
