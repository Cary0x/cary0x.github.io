# Common Scams

There are countless scammers out there waiting for you to make the wrong more.  One bad click can drain your entire wallet.

If the website is not `pondx.com`, `pond0x.com`, or `pondcoin.com`, leave immediately and report whoever sent you there.

## General Tips

- Always double-check URLs for official sites.
- - If you were connected before, but you aren't connected now, you are probably on a scam site.
- Never share your seed phrase or private key with anyone.
- - "But what about..." No. Never.
- Use password managers to avoid typing errors that lead to fake sites.
- Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) where possible.
- Get extremely familiar with the sites you use most often.  Read the transaction messages– every single word.  Understand the message.
- Practice running through all of the steps you may need to do in a high-pressure situation.  If you are planning on moving $10k quickly in the future, practice with $10 several times.

## Phishing

Scammers will impersonate trusted figures/platforms in an attempt to get you to click links to their website.  These website often look legitimate or exact copies of the ones you know.

Prevention Tips:

- Verify the sender. Check their @ address, their folower count, etc.
- - Note that even trusted figures can get hacked and send out bad links, so don't even blindly trust them.
- Verify the transaction before accepting it.  If it looks off, don't do it.

## Address Poisoning

Scammers will create wallets with extremely similar wallet addresses in the hopes that you interact with them instead of the legitimate wallet.  For example, they will send you tokens immediately after receiving tokens from the legitimate wallets with the hope that you will send tokens to the wrong address.

Here is an example of it happening with the swap reward address:

Tips:
  
- Verify the sender– the entire address.  Save the original.  Look at the solscan page.  Do everything you can to know that it is the correct one.  As computers get more powerful, scammers can get closer and closer to the real address.
- Don't use transaction history as a way to make transactions.
