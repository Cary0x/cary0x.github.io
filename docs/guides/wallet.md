# Getting Started

To fully participate with the Pond0x ecosystem, you will need a Solana wallet and an Etherium wallet.

If you used the Etherium version of Pond0x, you likely have badges and want to use them on the Solana Pond0x.

In either case, I recommend the Phantom wallet.

I generally will not add any links, but I believe that Phantom is fully trusted, so I will make an exception. DYOR.

## Notes

If you have another app like MetaMask wallet for Etherium, you can continue to use it, if you want.  It is likely easier to import that wallet into Phantom, but that is up to you.  The majority of actions performed on Pond0x will only require the Solana wallet to be connected.

I highly recommend doing all actions within the ecosystem on the same wallet pair.  Swapping, mining, locking, spawning, burning, etc. all combine into a shared set of boost, luck, reward modifiers, etc.  Doing this on separate wallets will give you fewer rewards.
