# Check In

> **Setup**. Configure your wallets to connect cross chain.\
> **Lift off**. Begin streaming your rewards.

![Checkin](img/checkin.png)

> **What is Check In?**\
> Confirms your rewards are sent to the correct destination on the right chain.
> To Mine, you need to Check In so rewards can be sent to you.

> **What is Priority?**\
> The order in which rewards are prioritized for sending.\
> If you do not complete Check In, your priority might change.

> **When can I Mine?**\
> Once the Check In window has completed, Mining begins. You will need SOL to Mine.

> **What is a Payout Test?**\
> You will receive a small payout on the destination chain to confirm where you will automatically continue to receive rewards.\
> Your Check In will be complete once you receive this amount.

I am not sure that this payout test is still being sent out. I would not wait for it to arrive to begin mining.

> **Can I use my badges?**\
> Once you Check In, you can Teleport (âš¡) your badges to Solana.

Checking in is relatively straightforward. As long as you have Eth and Sol wallets and some Sol, you should be good to go. Simply follow the on-screen prompts.

## Notes

The payout test may not be sending out anymore. Do not wait for it to begin mining.

If you want to connect your X account, do not skip that step. There is no way to do it afterwards at the moment.

Since the check in is not fully completed, I am not sure teleporting badges will work. This should likely get resolved once the test send is restored or removed as a requirement.
