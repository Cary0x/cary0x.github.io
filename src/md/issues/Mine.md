### Mining "Stuck" at 1.6M

Mining will sometimes start, show hash, show the cryptography animation, and appear to be working, but then stick at 1.5M forever.  This was much more frequent early on, but does happen from time to time.  I believe this is when the backend collecting these hashes is in maintenance mode.  

Check the TL.  People call this out very quickly and will also mention when it starts working again.  You can also check Magick's visualization tool, but DYOR and click links very carefully.
