### Did Not Receive Stand Badge ~~Non-issue~~

~~I see many reports of folks signing the petition prior to the deadline but not receiving the Stand badge.~~

Users experiencing this issue have issues with their X connection.  This will likely be resolved once the X issue is fixed.

I am still seeing this issue.  Here is an example:

8u8ERxEzt8K37Dedsuy6mhVtEMhgXSWJBLVqtESZyR6r is hasTwitter:true and put the [post in before the deadline](https://x.com/sharikov_alt/status/1853703691477385668). 

### PRO Not Displaying in UI

The way the PRO works seems odd. It counts up every day and expires above 30. It keeps counting up indefinitely.  The lowest I have seen is 1, implying buying more than 30 days doesn't count.  The highest I have seen is 100, implying you would need to buy 3 months (3*30) to get under 30 and into the &lt;30 PRO status.

I am confident this all works properly within the engine, but it doesn't seem to work quite right on the frontend.
