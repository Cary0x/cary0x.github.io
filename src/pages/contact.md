Welcome! I'm Cary0x, a dedicated developer and analyst within the Pond0x community. My primary focus is providing clear, fact-based updates and guidance to help reduce uncertainty and promote a positive environment. I share updates on code changes, document new features, and offer solutions to common issues to make the experience more enjoyable for all users.

If you‚Äôd like to stay connected or reach out, you can find me on X:

[**ùïè@Cary0x2**](https://x.com/Cary0x2)

*I will interchangably use Cary0x and Cary0x2.  I lost 0x supporting this project too hard.

**Please note:** While I‚Äôm committed to sharing valuable insights, my work is unofficial and independent of the Pond0x team. I strive to offer objective information to foster understanding and engagement. If you have any feedback, suggestions, or questions, feel free to connect!

Also, I do make a lot of tools and reports.  However, I am not comfortable with sharing code.  Code can run differently on every system and I do not want to be the cause of anyone getting drained.  The reports that I build have data that pairs more than the website.  I would prefer not to release data that would expose user wallets, their usage habits, etc. as it may contain personal information.
